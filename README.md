# MJ Online shoping
 
I have made this MJ Online shopping web Application with some basic functionalities of E-Ecomerce websites like authentication, lading page, sort options, categories, and cart page, etc. The whole web application is developed by using the MERN stack  for the frontend I use the reactJS and I use the nodeJS/Expres on backend  then for the database level I use the MongoDB with mongoose and in the UI design side I did not use any UI libraries.
